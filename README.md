# Exercise Monitoring using Wearable Sensors

This project implements an exercise monitoring system using wearable sensor data. The goal is to accurately detect and analyze physical exercises using data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Exercise_monitoring.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: (Not included) Expected to contain sensor data files (e.g., CSV format).
- `models/`: (Optional) Save trained models for reuse.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Sensor fusion of accelerometer and gyroscope data
- Feature selection using Pearson correlation and ANOVA
- Multiple machine learning models tested: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall
- Reduced sensor configuration analysis for real-world usability

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/exercise-monitoring.git
   cd exercise-monitoring
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Exercise_monitoring.ipynb` and run all cells sequentially.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used consists of time-series data from wearable sensors placed on different body parts. Each row includes:

* Accelerometer and gyroscope readings (x, y, z axes)
* Labels corresponding to different exercises

**Note:** Dataset not included in the repo due to size/privacy. Contact the author or modify paths accordingly.

## 🧪 Evaluation

The system achieves high accuracy with reduced sensor configurations, demonstrating feasibility for real-world deployment with fewer devices.

## 📌 Limitations

* Small number of participants
* Gender imbalance in dataset
* Real-time classification not implemented (offline only)
